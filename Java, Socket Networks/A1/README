compile by typing [make]
clean by typing [make clean]

after compilation: 
run server by typing [./server.sh <req_code>]
run client by typing [./client.sh <server address> <n_port> <req_code> <someMessage>]
start the server before starting clients.

If <someMessage> == GET , it retrieves messages from the server.
If <someMessage> == TERMINATE , it terminates the server.
Otherwise the message is saved in the server.

If the complete command is used to start the client, the client will terminate after sending the message.

When runing a client, the <req_code> and <someMessage> arguments are optional. These arguments can be typed in at runtime.
Under this setting, multiple messages can be sent to the server. The client wont be closed after sending the messages.
