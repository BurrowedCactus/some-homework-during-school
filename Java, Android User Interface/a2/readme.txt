2: ESC to cancel current selection is not working.
	A: the alternate approach 1 is to use the menu button "clear selection".
	B: the alternate approach 2 is to draw a random shape, select it then erase it. Then the selection is cleared.
3: In the menu, 
	A: file save, file load, view full screen, view fit to window does not work. 
	B: file new is working properly.
